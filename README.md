# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Stocks-Cholesky-Decomposition-
This project builds a Monte Carlo simulation to model future portfolio performance using historical stock data. It estimates mean returns and correlations, then generates realistic random asset paths using Cholesky decomposition and independent shocks to simulate multiple possible portfolio trajectories and assess risk.
